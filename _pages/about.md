I am a third-year PhD Fellow in the Horizon 2020 — Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions — COFUND European program [AI4TheSciences](https://psl.eu/en/research/major-research-projects/european-programs/ai4thesciences-doctoral-program), based at [Mines Paris – PSL University](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/en/home/) (Paris, France).

My PhD research focuses on advancing deep learning and computer vision for 3D data, with applications ranging from medical domain to broader 3D vision tasks. This includes working with transformer-based and convolutional deep learning architectures, as well as generative diffusion models.

Prior to my PhD, I worked as a deep learning research scientist at the [Universidad Politecnica de Madrid](https://www.gatv.ssr.upm.es/index.php/en/) (UPM), contributing to various deep learning solutions as part of European Union Horizon 2020 projects, such as [GenoMed4All](https://genomed4all.eu/) and [RESCUER](https://rescuerproject.eu/).  

During my master’s studies, I was awarded a scholarship for a Double MSc in Telecommunications Engineering between [Università di Padova](https://www.unipd.it) (Italy) and UPM (Spain), and conducted my final thesis on deep learning for LiDAR data in autonomous driving, focusing on 3D depth completion and object detection.

I am dedicated to innovative R&D in 3D vision, with a strong commitment to scientific contributions and publications.
