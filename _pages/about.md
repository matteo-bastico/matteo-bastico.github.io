<!--
Deep learning and 3D computer vision researcher specializing in medical applications for computer-aided modeling and markerless surgical planning.

During my PhD at Mines Paris – PSL, co-funded by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions COFUND program <a href="https://psl.eu/en/research/major-research-projects/european-programs/ai4thesciences-doctoral-program">AI4TheSciences</a>, I designed transformer- and convolution-based architectures, as well as generative diffusion models, for 3D medical imaging and point clouds. This work resulted in publications at top-tier international conferences including CVPR, 3DV, and ICCVW.

Previously, I worked as a Deep Learning Research Scientist at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, contributing to EU Horizon 2020 projects including GenoMed4All and PROCare4Life, where I coordinated technical teams and developed models for DNA analysis, medical imaging, and 3D skeletal data.

I hold a Double Master's Degree from the University of Padua and Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, where I completed a thesis on 3D depth completion and object detection for autonomous driving.

My research bridges innovative AI methods with practical clinical applications, with a focus on developing solutions that can make a meaningful impact in healthcare
-->
Deep learning and 3D computer vision researcher, currently focused on healthcare applications.

Over the past several years, I've developed large-scale transformer-based and convolutional architectures for diverse medical modalities (CT, MRI, 3D point clouds) and tasks (segmentation, landmarking, generative AI), with research published at top-tier conferences including CVPR, ICCVW, and 3DV.

I'm motivated by complex research challenges and the opportunity to bridge innovative AI methods with real-world applications, developing solutions that can make a meaningful impact on society.
